    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>A quesadilla is a Mexican dish that consists of a tortilla 
        filled with cheese (and often other ingredients, such as 
        meat and veggies). It’s cooked on a griddle or stove. Full 
        quesadillas feature cheese sandwiched between two flat 
        tortillas. Half quesadillas, like the one in this recipe, 
        is a single tortilla that has been topped with fillings and 
        folded into a half moon shape.

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: Of course, you’ll need chicken! This recipe calls for a pound of diced boneless, skinless chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Use store-bought fajita seasoning or make your own spice blend at home.</li> 
        <li>Vegetables: You’ll need green bell peppers, red bell peppers, and an onion.</li>
        <li>Tortillas: For 10 chicken quesadillas, you’ll need 10 flour tortillas. Use store-bought or homemade tortillas.</li> 
        <li>Cheese: A blend of shredded Cheddar and shredded Monterey Jack takes the quesadillas up a notch.</li> 
        <li>Bacon: Bacon bits lend a burst of savory, meaty texture to the cheesy chicken quesadilla filling. For a more traditional dish, you can easily omit the bacon bits.</li>
    </ul>
